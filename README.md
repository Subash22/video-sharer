Video sharing app made using django.

<h1>Setup django project:</h1>
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you wish to store the project and run the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/Subash22/video-sharer.git

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate into the repository.

Create a virtual environment and activate it using the following commands:
<p><i>python3 -m venv venv</i><br/>
<i>source venv/bin/activate</i></p><br/>

Once you've activated your virtual environment install your python packages by running:
<p><i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i></p><br/>

Now let's migrate our django project:
<p><i>python manage.py migrate</i></p><br/>

If there are no issues, you should now be able to open your server by running:
<p><i>python manage.py runserver</i></p><br/>
