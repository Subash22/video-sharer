Video sharing app made using django.

<h1>Setup django project:</h1>
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you wish to store the project and run the following commands:
git clone https://github.com/Subash22/video-sharer.git

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate into the repository.

Create a virtual environment and activate it using the following commands:
<p>python3 -m venv venv</p>
<p>source venv/bin/activate</p>

Once you've activated your virtual environment install your python packages by running:
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>

Now let's migrate our django project:
<p>python manage.py migrate</p>

If there are no issues, you should now be able to open your server by running:
<p>python manage.py runserver</p>
